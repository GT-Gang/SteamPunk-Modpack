Instructions for installing/updating the modpack with PrismLauncher.

## Installation

1. Download & Install [java17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17).
2. Download & Install [PrismLauncher](https://prismlauncher.org/).
3. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/GT-Gang/SteamPunk-Modpack/releases) and download the latest archive.
    - Download "QT-Gang-SteamPunk-v1.0.zip"
4. Open Prism Launcher and drag-and-drop the zip file into the Prism Launcher window:
5. While importing the modpack some mods won't be able to be downloaded automatically due to licensing reasons, you will be prompted with the window shown below.
    - **DO NOT PRESS "OK"**
    - Scroll through the list of mods and click on **ALL** the provided links to manually downloaded the mods. Make sure that the "Watched Folders" includes the directory where you are downloading the mods to.
        - Most likely your `C:\Users\<your PC username>\Downloads` folder
        - Double-check the drive if you have multiple drives

7. Opt in/out for optional mods, I would recommend just selecting all of them and then click "OK".
    - It should start download all the optional/other mods if you opted in

## Configuration

Select the instance created by the installation process, go to "Edit" and then "Settings" to configure Java to the correct version, if no other Java was installed, it will be the only one shown in the box created by "Auto-detect..." (2), otherwise, chose Java17

This should be all that is needed to play the mod pack for the server.
