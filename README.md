6. While importing the modpack some mods won't be able to be downloaded automatically due to licensing reasons, you will be prompted with this window:

Scroll through the list of mods and click on the provided links to manually downloaded the mods. Make sure that the "Watched Folders" includes the directory where you are downloading the mods to.

When you are done, it should say "All mods found" in the bottom left corner, as shown below. After that, click "Ok".

7. Opt in/out for optional mods, I would recommend just selecting all of them.

After pressing "Ok" it will start downloading all the other mods.

## Configuration

Select the instance created by the installation process, go to "Edit" and then "Settings" to configure Java to the correct version, if no other Java was installed, it will be the only one shown in the box created by "Auto-detect..." (2), otherwise, chose Java17
